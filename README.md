# Siege
Modular Post-Exploitation Tool for Red Teams (Work in progress)

# Payloads
This tool is not designed to have one payload, it is designed to have multiple payloads all for different purposes.

# Action
Actions are just that, actions. Payloads provide actions on a system depending on what they are capable of.
Actions remove the need for individual commands per-payload, but rather per-action and have multiple payloads support them.
